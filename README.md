# Homework 4a

This is my repo for HW 4 for SSW-567

### Part 2:

When it comes to applications that pull data from places such as API's that are out of the control of the developer, the developer can only do so much to make their software successful in its function. For this application, the test cases should not just test whether the information it is supposed to output accurate but it should really test whether the program successfully carries out its function, especially in the case of the Github API and its limited calls.

The most challenging part of this assignment was the limited API calls as well as effectively using the documentation of the Github API.
